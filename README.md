# Regan Shen - BBM

COS730 Assignment 3, the BBM system implemented by Regan Shen (u20460067). 2 new components have been added to the BBM system. This being the NPL model to identify hobbies and interestss and a automatic live time translator for messages.

## Description and Components Implemented
The innovation feature I will add is that Group chats will be created for like-
minded people in certain locations. These group chats will be made by the
system’s Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI will use Natural Language Processing
(NLP) to read through your messages and identify what you enjoy and hobbies
as well as geo-loaction. From there it will suggest group chats that you can
join that are for people with similar interests and these groups are filled with
people in the same location area. Example if I always talk about gym then the
AI will suggest that I join a gym group chat that was created for people in my
residential area. You can deny if you don’t want to join, but if you join you will
connect to this group chat with all the people that enjoy the same thing as you.
Another component that will be added is the ability for live translation be-
tween messages.A user will have the ability to select translation mode. This
will allow one person to send a message in their native language and it will be
displayed in another language on the recipients device, to promote communica-
tion between people who don’t speak the same language. This component will
once again use AI to identify the language of the other participant and auto-
matically translate between languages
