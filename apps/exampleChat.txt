2021/03/19, 10:31 - Regan Shen: Please can you post a review for me on hello Peter and on Google for one of my friends dad's companies

https://www.hellopeter.com/ac-direct

And make an account in your name and then post a review asseblief. Just go on about how easy it was to deal with them, how great their service was and how well it went with the installation of the aircons. 
 
The guy who owns it said he would hold a braai for us and cop us beers if we got a shit load of reviews but we need to do it from individual guys and have unique reviews 

So if you can ask the boys at res too please

2021/08/11, 20:32 - Sebastian Huggins: *For Immediate Release*
*11 August 2021*
 
*N3 TOLL ROUTE I WEATHER ALERT I 12  14 AUGUST 2021 | N3TC warns road users to take precautions as high winds and snowfall are predicted over the eastern parts of the Free State*

The South African Weather Service has issued a warning of high winds along parts of the N3 Toll Route on Thursday, Friday and Sunday this week. Snowfall is currently expected on Friday and Saturday along the Dihlabeng, Maluti a Phofung and Phumelela districts. This includes a section of the N3 Toll Route from Van Reenens Pass to Warden.

High winds, and the increased possibility of snow, may affect road conditions and the flow of traffic, causing congestion and delays, and the possible closure of sections of the N3 Toll Route in the interest of safety. Road users are advised to stay informed of conditions for travelling on the route; to avoid night time travel when temperatures may suddenly drop and visibility is generally very poor; and to delay their trips if the inclement weather conditions become too treacherous.

N3 Toll Concession (N3TC) is making every attempt to ensure general safety of all its road users along the N3 Toll Route. 

Our road incident management system (RIMS) including emergency medical services, law enforcement, the road traffic inspectorate, local authorities and route patrol services, have already been mobilised and are ready to provide support where required. 

Transport and logistics operators, particularly those with livestock and perishable loads, should be aware of the expected inclement weather and possibility of traffic disruptions which may result, and are advised to plan accordingly.

Furthermore, N3TC appeals to motorists and the general public to avoid the regions where snowfall may occur and, if possible, to rather delay their trips. 

So-called snow chasers place an additional burden on limited emergency resources, and often cause havoc on the roads during already dangerous conditions, stresses N3TCs operations manager, Thania Dhoogra.  

Should you have no option but to travel, N3TC advises that road users stay aware of weather warnings and the possibility of associated road closures. Conditions may change quickly, thus it is important to be well prepared for any eventuality. Keep extra blankets, a torch, food and refreshments in your vehicle in the event of lengthy road closures. People with medical conditions, or traveling with babies, should ensure that they travel with sufficient baby supplies and medication, explains Ms Dhoogra. 

Adverse weather conditions may cause power failures and communication systems may be under pressure. Keep in mind that you may not be able to make contact with people if mobile and telecommunication networks are down.

It is highly recommended that road users only obtain and circulate information a trusted news source. False news is harmful. 

Obtain real-time and verified traffic and weather updates, report problems or obtain emergency assistance whilst travelling on the N3 Toll Route from N3TCs 24-hour N3 Helpline by dialing 0800 63 43 57 or by following @N3Route on Twitter. 

N3 Toll Concession (N3TC) manages 415 km of the N3 Toll Route from the Cedara Interchange in KwaZulu-Natal to the Heidelberg South Interchange in Gauteng.

2021/08/12, 12:01 - Regan Shen: Ya
2021/08/12, 14:03 - Regan Shen: 
2021/08/12, 14:07 - Sebastian Huggins:

2021/08/12, 17:08 - Regan Shen: We will make a call at escourt i guess
2021/08/12, 17:10 - Regan Shen: Give me 2 seconds gonna check the weather, the main concern is the ice, cause my whole thing is its snowing which is okay cause the temperature at van reenens doesn't get below 0 degrees, right so the snow will melt when it lands on the tar, essentially we just gonna drive in the rain, so slow and steady up van reenes will be chilled
2021/08/12, 17:15 - Regan Shen: Seb the lowest van reenens will get is 2 degrees. Right i did some research, and so ice only starts forming on tar at the temperature of 34f or below. And 2C is 38f so I think we good
2021/08/12, 17:59 - Sebastian Huggins: 
2021/08/12, 18:03 - Regan Shen: I'm gonna check tomorrow morning before I leave if the road is open

2022/11/21, 15:52 - Sebastian Huggins: Well it's a street track, it'll be far too short and narrow for F1. Watch some of the Formula E races and you'll see what I mean, F1 needs much longer and wider tracks to make it viable
