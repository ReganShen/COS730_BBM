Currently we have topics, hwoever these topics need to be classified.
So I will make a dataset with topics and the keywords this will be used to classifier some topics and if I't can't identify
and key words then it will ask for user input.
Need to also add such that if a word from the topics does not exist on our basic model then it will add it to the correct classification of the topic. So if the word intelligence is not on AI then add it
